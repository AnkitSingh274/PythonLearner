# Day 1: NumPy Basics

Today I practiced NumPy fundamentals including array creation, reshape, slicing and basic operations.

import numpy as np

# 1D array
arr1d = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr1d

# 2D array
arr2d = np.array([
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    [2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
    [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
])
arr2d

arr_range = np.arange(1, 11)
arr_range

## Array Slicing

Here I practiced slicing to select specific rows and columns from a NumPy array.

### What I Learned
- Creating 1D and 2D NumPy arrays
- Understanding shape of arrays
- Using arange and reshape
- Column slicing using index lists
